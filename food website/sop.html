                        <h3> <u>Ingredients</u></h3>
                        <p>1 heaped cup wheat flour</p>
                        <p>1/2 cup loosely packed chopped spring onion</p>
                        <p>1/8 tsp turmeric powder</p>
                        <p>1/4 tsp jeera powder</p>
                        <p>1/2 tsp garam masala powder</p>
                        <p>1 tsp oil</p>
                        <p>salt to taste</p>
                        <p>water as needed</p>
                        <p>ghee or oil to toast</p>
                        
                        <h3> <u>Steps</u> </h3>
                        <p>1>To a mixing bowl - add wheat flour. Clean spring onion, rinse it well then fine chop it and add it.</p>
                        <p>2>Add jeera powder, garam masala powder, turmeric powder and required salt. Add oil.</p>
                        <p>3>First mix this well with your finger tip. Then add water little by little.</p>
                        <p>4>Knead to a smooth pliable dough. Close and set aside for 10mins.</p>
                        <p>5>Roll into big lemon sized balls. Dust flour on the rolling surface, and roll it thick or thin as per your preference. I made it just like chapathi.</p>
                        <p>6>Heat dosa tawa, add the paratha one by one, when it starts to bubble drizzle oil and cook on the other side.</p>
                        <p>7>Cook until both the sides are evenly cooked. Repeat to finish the dough. Make and stack the parathas in a hot pack or serve it immediately.</p>
                        <p>8>Serve Spring Onion Paratha hot with pickle and side dish of your choice.</p>
